    <h1>Number guessing game</h1>

    <p>
      We will select some random numbers between 1 and 100. <br>
      You can decide how many numbers to guess before the game starts.<br>
      See if you can guess them "within 10 turns" and "within 100 seconds". <br>
      We'll tell you if your guesses were too high or too low.<br>
      When a number is answered correctly, the time remaining at that moment is added to the score.<br>
      If you can't guess it "within 10 turns" or "within 100 seconds", total score is 0. <br>
    </p>
